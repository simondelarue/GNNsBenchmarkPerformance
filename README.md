# Graph Neural Network benchmark with simple baselines

We compare famous Graph Neural Network based models with simple baselines. The motivation of this work is to provide a reproducible framework to evaluate recent advances in the GNN field. In recent literature, GNN are rarely compared to simple approaches; we argue that in some cases these baseline methods can achieve competitive results and would like to explore when exactly it is useful to leverage complex models.

## Usage
